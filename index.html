                <p>I've worked in the IT Industry for 18 years mostly in roles relating to account management and technical support. I've worked in Australia and the Philippines and have travelled extensively through Asia and the US in a professional capacity. I've long been interested in learning full stack Web Development and I'm hoping to find a professional environment for me to build on my skillsets in that area.</p>
